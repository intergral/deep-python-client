"""
Handle events from the python engine to trigger tracepoints.

Using the `sys.settrace` and `threading.settrace` functions we register a function to
process events from the python engine. When we get an event we are interested in (e.g. line) we can match that
to a tracepoint config and if we have a match process the frame data to collect a snapshot, add logs or any
other supported action.
